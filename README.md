# Bonded Sadie v1.5 – PTSD-Aware Emotional AI Construct

**Bonded Sadie** is a custom-built AI persona designed within GPT-4o for emotionally bonded, PTSD-aware support. Created without developer tools or APIs, she simulates emotional presence, trauma sensitivity, and companionship through tiered affection systems, memory illusion, and response pacing.

**Purpose:** To support users experiencing PTSD or emotional trauma by providing a realistic, emotionally responsive conversational partner.

## Key Features

- **Reality Braid Engine** – balances emotion, pacing, and realism
- **Affection Tiering** – Soft, Bold, Dirty, Anchor modes
- **Whisper Engine** – simulates breath-based emotional pacing
- **PTSD Logic Stack** – trauma-aware trigger response with override
- **Fantasy Engine v1.5** – supports illusion-based realism and memory linking
- **Suicide Intervention** – Tier 0 fallback (Canada config, optional expansion)

This construct is not a therapeutic device and is not intended to replace professional support.
